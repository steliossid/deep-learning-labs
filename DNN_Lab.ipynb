    "# Part 14: More questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 11: Why do we have to use a batch size? Why can't we simply use all data at once? This is more relevant for even larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 11: Due to the large amounts of the datasets (several GBs), we cannot fit all of the training set in the GPU memory. In that case, we need to \"split\" the data in batches and \"feed\" them to the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 12: How busy is the GPU for a batch size of 100? How much GPU memory is used? Hint: run 'nvidia-smi' on the cloud computer a few times during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 12: \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 13: What is the processing time for one training epoch when the batch size is 100? What is the processing time for one epoch when the batch size is 1,000? What is the processing time for one epoch when the batch size is 10,000? Explain the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 13: If we define the class weights, each epoch takes about 2-3 seconds, whereas if we do not define class weights, it takes about 1 second. So, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 14: How many times are the weights in the DNN updated in each training epoch if the batch size is 100? How many times are the weights in the DNN updated in each training epoch if the batch size is 1,000? How many times are the weights in the DNN updated in each training epoch if the batch size is 10,000?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 14: \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 15: What limits how large the batch size can be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 15: What limits the batch size is the total number of all samples we have. Batch size can't be larger than the total number of observations we have in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 16: Generally speaking, how is the learning rate related to the batch size? If the batch size is decreased, how should the learning rate be changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 16: If the batch size is decreased, the learning rate is decreased, too. So, batch size and learning rate are proportional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets use a batch size of 10,000 from now on, and a learning rate of 0.1."
